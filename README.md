# GGDA-cyclist-case-study
This is a data analytic project from Google Data Analyst Course. This research takes a look at different customer behavior when using Cyclist's public bike service
# BACKGROUND
    In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
    Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
    This report will examine the business question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?", and it will be done in the process of: Ask, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

# ASK - A clear statement of the business task
    This report will demonstrates the differences in bike usage of the two types of customers: casual riders and Cyclistic members, which will help Cyclistic understand different customer behavior and make necessary modifications to their service in order to improve customers' experience.
